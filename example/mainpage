 *  @mainpage Example Program for the Embecosm RSP Dummy Server
 *
 *  @section intro_sec About
 *
 *  This is a simple program which can be compiled with the OpenRISC 1000
 *  toolchain to create a binary image compatible with the RSP Dummy Server
 *  configuration file "or1k.cfg".
 *
 *  @section install_sec Installation
 *
 *  This directory is not intended to be installed directly. If the OpenRISC
 *  1000 toolchain is stalled, the binary can be rebuilt using the
 *  Makefile. However unless the toolchain matches exactly that used when
 *  creating the example, the result may not be compatible with or1k.cfg. For
 *  this reason, the binary image (file hello) is also distributed.
 *
 *  The Makefile may need editing to change the name and/or location of the
 *  OpenRISC 1000 compiler and linker tools.
 *
 *  The Makefile target "doc" can be used to rebuild this Doxygen
 *  documentation. It requires doxygen (see <http://www.doxygen.org/>) to be
 *  installed. PDF output also requires TeX (see <http://www.tug.org/>) to be
 *  installed.
